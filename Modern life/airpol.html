<h4><i><b>Effects:</b></h4></i>
<h3>Almost any toxic chemical could make its way into the atmosphere to pollute the air that we breathe. 
Air pollution has serious effects on the human health. 
Depending on the level of exposure and the type of pollutant inhaled,
 these effects can vary, ranging from simple symptoms like coughing and the irritation of the respiratory tract to acute conditions like asthma and chronic lung diseases.</h3>
<h3>In most cases, air pollutants cannot be seen or smelled. 
However, that does not mean that they do not exist in high enough amounts to be a health hazard! 
Additionally, a number of gases are linked to the so-called "greenhouse effect".</h3>
