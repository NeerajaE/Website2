<h1>In villages or past days we had many points to be discussed.<br></h1>
<h1><ul><li>The main point is about the pollution where there are less vehicles and also the technology is not that much developed <br>
<li>There is lot of fresh air from the tree and plants <br></li>
<li>Which looks in pure green  color and gives pure oxygen<br>
<li>In OLDEN  days people used to spent time with families  in thise days there are no phones and other communication modes like social media<br>
<li>And also they used cultivate the crop where evry thing is pur efrom crops<br></ul>
<h2>But in these modern days in each and evry thing chemicals are added wher they can get easily problems in  eating anyrhing <br>
</h2><h1><ul><li>In olden days both men and women used to carry water in pots from miles away fro m the village<br></li></ul>
</h1><h2>But in these days every one is maintaining an aquaguard and also keeping the water can on any mode of transport and surviving<br>
</h2><h1><ul><li>In those days they used to go for water on  bear foot without any mode of tranport<br>
<li>And also they carry lots of weight on their head for work both men and women are strong in those days in carrying l.arge weights<br>
<li>There are no security issues where they can go anywhere anytime in  their place and also every one respecgt each other <br>
</li></ul></h1><h2>Now a days also their is respect towards people but in spome issues some people are behaving cruelly and are killi ng the people and women  are not getting securely to home and are not daring to go oiut of home in  midnighnt <br>
<h1><ul><li>In those days one can go by walk for long miles and do their work and rerturn home <br>
<li>And in  those days there are no mobile phones where every one use o communicate throgh letters are telecommunicationetc</br></li>
<li>They used to enjoy their lives in spending together with family<br></li></ul>
<h2>->And also evey one are having  avehicle now a days and creating pollution but for their uses it is compulsory and we should also respect it ,
But we should minimise it by going walk or cycle for less distances and educate people in this where one can learn this in their lifes.<br></h2>
<h2>->But it is a plus in  modern life where very one is getting their needs in front of their home by many online apps and also mobiles phon es camn change their life for communicating  wih near ones and also it is in one point of view helpful in education of childs life and also as well as it is harmfull in playing games continously<br>
->And also in these days we can say that it is a benefit to people where every one is traveeling through the world with their own earnings<br>
->Main important thing is that spending time with family in these modern life is not possible as every one are usy with their work and also they are getting time schedule for gathering as it is the most heritage situation<br>
